# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Diabetes Prediction
This project compares multiple machine learning models—such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and MLP Neural Network—for predicting diabetes based on clinical features. 
The workflow includes data preprocessing, outlier handling, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
## Dataset
The project uses the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset, containing 768 samples with 8 medical predictor variables such as glucose level, BMI, and insulin level.
## Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
2. Outlier Removal using IQR
3. Standardization of Features
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Model Training (SVM, RF, MLP)
6. Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
7. Comparison of Performance
